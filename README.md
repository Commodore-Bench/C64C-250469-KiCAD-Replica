# discrepancies notes
- Global label INTRES near U6, a INTRES net is crossing, but there is no junction.
- C8 in the schematics is the same as C2 in the layout
- 9VAC global label seems to point the wrong direction
- R16 is anonymous in the schematic
- Power Switch symbols have no reference number and no pin numbers.

- kicad labels will not have slash inside ~{}, but will have them in symbol pin names
